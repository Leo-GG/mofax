![MOFA+ in Python](img/mofax_header.png)

Work with trained factor models in Python.

This library provides convenience functions to load and visualize factor models trained with MOFA+ in Python â€“ hence the name. For more information on the multi-omics factor analysis v2 framework please see [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2).

## Getting started

### Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/gtca/mofax
```

### Training a factor model

Please see the [MOFA+ GitHub repository](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2) for more information on training the factor models with MOFA+.

### Loading the model

Import the module and create a connection to the HDF5 file with the trained model:

```python
import mofax

model = mfx.mofa_model("trained_mofaplus_model.hdf5")
```

The connection is created in the readonly mode by default and can be terminated by calling the `close()` method on the model object.

#### Model object

Model object is an instance of a `mofa_model` class that wraps around the HDF5 connection and provides a simple way to address the parts of the trained model such as expectations for factors and for their loadings eliminating the need to traverse the HDF5 file manually.

#### Model methods

Simple data structures (e.g. lists or dictionaries) are returned upon calling the properties of the mofa model, e.g. `model.shape`:

```python
model.shape
# returns (10138, 1124)
#         cells^  ^features
```

More complex structures are returned when using methods such as `model.get_cells()` to get `cell -> group` assignment as a pandas.DataFrame while also providing the way to only get this information for specific groups or views of the model.


```python
model.get_cells().head()
# returns a pandas.DataFrame object:
# 	group	cell
# 0	T_CD4	AATCCTGCACATCGCC-1
# 1	T_CD4	AAGACGTGTGATGCCC-1
# 2	T_CD4	AAGGAGCGTCGGCATG-1
# 3	T_CD4	AATCCGTCACGAGACG-1
# 4	T_CD4	ACACCGAGGAGGTTGA-1
```

#### Utility functions

A few utility functions such as `calculate_factor_r2` to calculate the variance explained by a factor are provided as well.

#### Plotting functions

A few basic plots can be constructed with plotting functions provided such as `plot_factors` and `plot_weights`. They rely on and limited by plotting functionality of Seaborn.

Please [check the notebooks](notebooks/) for detailed examples.
